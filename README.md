# Awesome-Dual-System-VLA

To address the challenges in vision-language-action models (VLAs), such as the difficulty of achieving efficient real-time performance, the high cost of pre-training, and the complexity of end-to-end fine-tuning on embodied data due to domain shift and catastrophic forgetting, Dual-System VLAs were introduced. 

The development and architectural details of Dual-System VLAs are discussed in the [paper](xxx).

This repository will be continuously updated, and we warmly welcome contributions from the community. If you have papers, projects, or resources that are not yet included, please feel free to submit them via a pull request or open an issue for discussion.
